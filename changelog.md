* Experimental: Fix mouse tracking in WinUI apps by making `obj.appModule.isGoodUIAWindow` always return `True` when an object with a specific `windowClassName` property is encountered.
  * Windows Terminal: If the text unit is a paragraph, moving the mouse in the Terminal control restricts the text unit to lines.
* Electron: cleaned up some unnecessary judgment logic.
* Update add-on template.
